## Overview
This repo provides the data, code, and website for our work on "Cellular deconstruction of inflamed synovium defines diverse inflammatory phenotypes in rheumatoid arthritis". The data is generated through a collaborative effort with NIH funded [AMP RA/SLE (Accelerating Medicines Partnership Rheumatoid Arthritis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus)](https://www.niams.nih.gov/grants-funding/funded-research/accelerating-medicines/RA-SLE).


```
- RA Synovial Single-cell Multimodal (transcriptomics and Proteomics) Cell Atlas
- Inflammatory tissue stratification: RA Synovial Cell Type Abundance Phenotypes (CTAPs)
- Associations of certain CTAPs with disease-relevant cytokines, histology, serology metrics
- Reveal significant associations between RA causal genes and cell type-specific synovial CTAPs
- Infer inflammatory phenotypes from clinical trial bulk RNA-seq of RA synovial tissue
- Functional cell-cell interaction and immune mediator assays
- Microscopy analysis for different synovial phenotypes 
```
