# RA_Atlas_CITEseq

## Overview
This repo provides the data, code, and website for our work on "Cellular deconstruction of inflamed synovium defines diverse inflammatory phenotypes in rheumatoid arthritis". The data is generated through a collaborative effort with NIH funded [AMP RA/SLE (Accelerating Medicines Partnership Rheumatoid Arthritis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus)](https://www.niams.nih.gov/grants-funding/funded-research/accelerating-medicines/RA-SLE).

The preprint version of our manuscript can be viewed and cited: [Zhang*, Jonsson*, Nathan*, Wei*, Millard*, et al, bioRxiv, 2022.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.25.481990v1.abstract)

- Inflammatory tissue stratification/classification: RA Synovial Cell Type Abundance Phenotypes (CTAPs)
- Associations of certain CTAPs with disease-relevant cytokines, histology, serology metrics, and causal RA genetics
- Infer inflammatory phenotypes from clinical trial bulk RNA-seq of RA synovial tissue
- Functional cell-cell interaction and immune mediator assays validate the biologically distinct environments
- Microscopy analysis for different synovial phenotypes
